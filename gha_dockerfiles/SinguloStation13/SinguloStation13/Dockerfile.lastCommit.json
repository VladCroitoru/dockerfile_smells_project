Other\r\nplatforms should use their package manager or download it from\r\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/download/\r\n\r\nPick one:\r\n\r\n- VSCode: `Ctrl+Shift+B`\r\n- VSCode: `F5` (build & run with debugger) or `Ctrl+F5` (build & run\r\n  without debugger)\r\n- Windows: double-click root `Build.bat` (pause to see output) or\r\n  `tools/build/build.bat` (no pause)\r\n- Git Bash and non-Windows: `tools/build/build`\r\n\r\n- TGS scripts will automatically install the version of Node specified\r\n  in `dependencies.sh`\r\n- Either use this build script, or compile tgui by running any script\r\n  in `tgui/bin` folder.\r\n\r\nBoth dm and tgui are now built with a single script. It's pretty easy\r\nto launch: just press `Ctrl+Shift+B` in VSCode, and tada! 🎉\r\n\r\n**It's smart.** It will skip certain steps if source files were\r\nuntouched for that step. So, if you're only touching dm code, it will\r\nonly rebuild dm code, and will skip tgui.\r\n\r\n**Syntax is fairly readable and maintainable.**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { Task, runTasks, exec } = require('./cbt');\r\n\r\nconst taskTgui = new Task('tgui')\r\n  .depends('tgui/yarn.lock')\r\n  .depends('tgui/packages/**/*.js')\r\n  .provides('tgui/public/*.bundle.*')\r\n  .provides('tgui/public/*.chunk.*')\r\n  .build(async () => {\r\n    await exec('tgui/bin/tgui');\r\n  });\r\n\r\nrunTasks([taskTgui]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This is a long term solution to the js bundle hell.** Now that we\r\nhave a single script to build everything, bundles have been excluded\r\nfrom the repo, and they will no longer cause conflicts in PRs. This\r\nresults in quicker PR turnaround time and less time wasted on\r\nrebuilding tgui for PRs.\r\n\r\n**CI pipelines have been updated.** They're not coded in the most\r\noptimal way, just making them green for now.\r\n\r\n- Support compiling with DM defines by passing them as an argument,\r\n  like `-D LOWMEMORYMODE`.\r\n- Instead of explicitly listing the task sequence in `runTasks()`,\r\n  support specifying tasks in `.depends()`, which in turn will allow\r\n  building a graph of dependencies and running things in parallel.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Tad Hardesty <tad@platymuus.com>\r\n\r\n- Add root Build.bat\r\n- Add trio of tools/bootstrap/ scripts for Node\r\n- Add tools/build/README.md\r\n- Ensure build script and VSC configuration works properly on Linux\r\n- Update TGS4 PreCompile scripts\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Jordan Brown <Cyberboss@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n- Keep PreCompile scripts compatible with TGS3 as well\r\n- Update LinuxOneShot PreCompile scripts\r\n- Update TGS4 configuration\r\n\r\n* Update Dockerfile for CBT (#56175)\r\n\r\nFollow-up to fix the failing Docker CI on master.\r\n\r\n- Reorganize the entire Dockerfile to be more readable\r\n- Inline the tgstation/byond Dockerfile into our own, so we can change the base distro at will\r\n- Also allows us to trash the dependencies.sh<->Dockerfile hack\r\n- Use 32-bit libs on a 64-bit distro so that we can download and run recent 64-bit Node binaries\r\n- Call tools/build/build rather than DreamMaker directly\r\n\r\n* Added autofocus for the first button in the TGUI list input.

This is undesirable.\r\n\r\n* Use new path to dmi.test in CI suite\r\n\r\n* Validate system Python version in bootstrap script\r\n\r\n* Add install advice to bootstrap script\r\n\r\n* Update path to requirements.txt in CI\r\n\r\n* Add upgrader for existing installations\r\n\r\n* Add .dmm merge driver (#55699)\r\n\r\nThis is kind of a prototype. It only fully handles a few situations,\r\nand doesn't produce particularly easy-to-read conflict markers when it\r\nfails. I hope that it can be useful at least some of the time, can be\r\nimproved over time, and that the lessons learned can influence a future\r\ninteractive GUI conflict resolver (integrated into StrongDMM?). In the\r\nworst case, one can fall back to the tried and true \"manually re-do one\r\nside's changes\" strategy.\r\n\r\n**Automatic use**: In `tools/hooks/`, run `Install.bat`\r\n\r\n**Manual use**, for Git GUIs that don't run merge drivers: while a\r\nmerge is in progress, in `tools/mapmerge2/`, double-click `Resolve Map\r\nConflicts.bat`\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes the error-prone \"Prepare Maps.bat\" /\r\n\"mapmerge.bat\" workflow. Those who aren't using the hooks should\r\ninstead use `Run Before Committing.bat` before committing.

Other\r\nplatforms should use their package manager or download it from\r\nhttps://nodejs.org/en/download/\r\n\r\nPick one:\r\n\r\n- VSCode: `Ctrl+Shift+B`\r\n- VSCode: `F5` (build & run with debugger) or `Ctrl+F5` (build & run\r\n  without debugger)\r\n- Windows: double-click root `Build.bat` (pause to see output) or\r\n  `tools/build/build.bat` (no pause)\r\n- Git Bash and non-Windows: `tools/build/build`\r\n\r\n- TGS scripts will automatically install the version of Node specified\r\n  in `dependencies.sh`\r\n- Either use this build script, or compile tgui by running any script\r\n  in `tgui/bin` folder.\r\n\r\nBoth dm and tgui are now built with a single script. It's pretty easy\r\nto launch: just press `Ctrl+Shift+B` in VSCode, and tada! 🎉\r\n\r\n**It's smart.** It will skip certain steps if source files were\r\nuntouched for that step. So, if you're only touching dm code, it will\r\nonly rebuild dm code, and will skip tgui.\r\n\r\n**Syntax is fairly readable and maintainable.**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { Task, runTasks, exec } = require('./cbt');\r\n\r\nconst taskTgui = new Task('tgui')\r\n  .depends('tgui/yarn.lock')\r\n  .depends('tgui/packages/**/*.js')\r\n  .provides('tgui/public/*.bundle.*')\r\n  .provides('tgui/public/*.chunk.*')\r\n  .build(async () => {\r\n    await exec('tgui/bin/tgui');\r\n  });\r\n\r\nrunTasks([taskTgui]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This is a long term solution to the js bundle hell.** Now that we\r\nhave a single script to build everything, bundles have been excluded\r\nfrom the repo, and they will no longer cause conflicts in PRs. This\r\nresults in quicker PR turnaround time and less time wasted on\r\nrebuilding tgui for PRs.\r\n\r\n**CI pipelines have been updated.** They're not coded in the most\r\noptimal way, just making them green for now.\r\n\r\n- Support compiling with DM defines by passing them as an argument,\r\n  like `-D LOWMEMORYMODE`.\r\n- Instead of explicitly listing the task sequence in `runTasks()`,\r\n  support specifying tasks in `.depends()`, which in turn will allow\r\n  building a graph of dependencies and running things in parallel.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Tad Hardesty <tad@platymuus.com>\r\n\r\n- Add root Build.bat\r\n- Add trio of tools/bootstrap/ scripts for Node\r\n- Add tools/build/README.md\r\n- Ensure build script and VSC configuration works properly on Linux\r\n- Update TGS4 PreCompile scripts\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Jordan Brown <Cyberboss@users.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\n- Keep PreCompile scripts compatible with TGS3 as well\r\n- Update LinuxOneShot PreCompile scripts\r\n- Update TGS4 configuration\r\n\r\n* Update Dockerfile for CBT (#56175)\r\n\r\nFollow-up to fix the failing Docker CI on master.\r\n\r\n- Reorganize the entire Dockerfile to be more readable\r\n- Inline the tgstation/byond Dockerfile into our own, so we can change the base distro at will\r\n- Also allows us to trash the dependencies.sh<->Dockerfile hack\r\n- Use 32-bit libs on a 64-bit distro so that we can download and run recent 64-bit Node binaries\r\n- Call tools/build/build rather than DreamMaker directly\r\n\r\n* Added autofocus for the first button in the TGUI list input.
